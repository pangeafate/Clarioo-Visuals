## Key Decisions Log

### November 12, 2024 - Prototype Pivot
**Decision**: Convert MVP to visual prototype with dummy data
**Rationale**:
- Focus on team alignment and design validation
- Reduce complexity before backend investment
- Enable rapid iteration on UX/UI
- Create clean handoff for backend integration

**Impact**:
- Removed: Supabase, OpenAI, real auth
- Added: Mock services, JSON dummy data
- Archived: All functional code for future restoration
- Timeline: Prototype in 1-2 weeks vs. months for functional MVP

**Next Review**: After stakeholder feedback on prototype

### November 12, 2024 - Visual Design Enhancement Sprint (SP_007) Planned
**Decision**: Create SP_007 focused on visual design enhancement and mobile-first UI/UX implementation
**Rationale**:
- Analysis of VISION MODIFIED.md revealed significant gap between current implementation and design vision
- Sophisticated UI/UX features (iPod navigation, animations, logo carousels, viral sharing) are core differentiators
- Mobile-first philosophy (80-90% mobile traffic) requires immediate implementation
- Design validation should precede backend investment
- Visual polish makes prototype more impressive for stakeholder presentations
- Prototype phase is optimal time for design experimentation (no backend constraints)

**Impact**:
- Implements 6 major design enhancement areas (landing page, criteria visualization, vendor discovery animation, comparison matrix redesign, community templates, mobile optimizations)
- Establishes mobile-first architecture foundation
- Adds innovative interactions that differentiate from competitors
- Enables viral sharing features (link + PDF export)
- Creates "aha moments" at each step to drive user engagement
- Defers component refactoring to future sprint (after design validation)

**Next Review**: After SP_007 completion and stakeholder feedback

### November 12, 2024 - Component Refactoring Deferred
**Decision**: Defer component refactoring sprint originally planned for SP_007
**Rationale**:
- Design features have higher strategic priority than code quality improvements
- Visual demonstration is more valuable for stakeholder feedback
- Component refactoring can be done after design validation
- Design changes may require component restructuring anyway
- No backend integration means technical debt is manageable

**Impact**:
- Component refactoring moved to future sprint (potentially SP_008 or later)
- Focus remains on user-facing improvements
- Technical debt acknowledged and tracked for future resolution
- Better alignment with design-first development philosophy

**Next Review**: After SP_007 completion

### November 12, 2024 - Sprint 8 Service Layer Refactoring (SP_008)
**Decision**: Execute focused service layer and testing sprint before visual enhancements
**Rationale**:
- Identified code duplication and type system fragmentation during component analysis
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach requires test framework first
- Clean architecture foundation benefits future development
- Easier to refactor with tests in place
- GL-TDD and GL-RDD compliance requires addressing technical debt early

**Impact**:
- Created comprehensive test suite (81 tests, 100% passing)
- Established Vitest testing framework with 80%+ coverage targets
- Extracted business logic into reusable hooks (useVendorComparison, useVendorDiscovery, useExecutiveSummary)
- Centralized type definitions in `/src/types/` directory
- Created export utilities (exportHelpers.ts)
- Refactored 3 major components to use new architecture
- Established foundation for future TDD development

**Next Review**: Ongoing - maintain test coverage and code quality standards

### November 12, 2024 - Sprint 10 Unified Landing & Workflow Integration (SP_010)
**Decision**: Create unified single-page experience eliminating navigation between marketing and workflow
**Rationale**:
- Identified disjointed user experience with separate landing page and dashboard
- Navigation to `/dashboard` broke user context and interrupted flow
- Marketing content remained visible even after authentication (poor UX)
- Multi-page architecture created cognitive load and context switching
- Sprint SP_009 provided foundation (workflow persistence, input connection) enabling unified approach

**Implementation Approach**:
- Replicated proven pattern from Index.tsx (selectedProject state management)
- Conditional rendering based on authentication state (pre-auth vs. post-auth)
- Framer Motion AnimatePresence for smooth transitions (400ms fade-out, 500ms fade-in)
- AuthModal simplified to close on success - LandingPage detects auth state via useAuth
- No routing changes - everything happens on single landing page
- Component reuse - ProjectDashboard and VendorDiscovery unchanged

**Impact**:
- Seamless single-page experience from marketing → authentication → workflow
- Context preservation - AnimatedInputs remain visible throughout
- No navigation breaks - smooth transition between states
- Better mobile experience - no page reloads or URL changes
- Scalable architecture - easy to add more workflow steps
- Maintained backward compatibility - `/dashboard` route still works as fallback

**Technical Benefits**:
- Clean state management with clear separation of concerns
- Type-safe implementation with TypeScript
- Easy to test - clear pre-auth and post-auth states
- Maintainable - clear separation between marketing and workflow
- Performance - no page reloads, instant transitions

**Next Review**: After manual testing and stakeholder feedback

### November 12, 2024 - Budget and Urgency Fields Removed from TechInput
**Decision**: Remove budget and urgency fields from Step 1 (TechInput) of the vendor discovery workflow
**Rationale**:
- Budget and urgency fields identified as premature in the discovery phase
- Users typically don't have concrete budget information at technology exploration stage
- Urgency can create artificial pressure and reduce thoughtful vendor evaluation
- Fields added unnecessary complexity to Step 1 workflow
- Removal streamlines initial user input and reduces friction
- Budget/timeline considerations can be addressed later in vendor negotiation phase

**Impact**:
- TechInput form simplified to focus on core inputs: technology description and company context
- Cleaner, more focused Step 1 experience with less cognitive load
- Improved workflow state management (fewer fields to persist)
- Better alignment with user journey (exploration → criteria → vendors → comparison → budget/timeline)
- Form validation simplified
- localStorage data structure updated to exclude removed fields

**Technical Changes**:
- Removed budget and urgency field components from TechInput.tsx
- Updated TechInputFormData type definitions
- Updated workflow state persistence logic
- Modified form validation schema
- Updated tests to reflect new form structure

**Next Review**: After user testing and feedback on simplified Step 1 workflow

### November 13, 2024 - Registration-Free Landing Experience (SP_011)
**Decision**: Create SP_011 to remove registration barrier and enable guest mode exploration
**Rationale**:
- Current prototype requires authentication before users can explore the workflow
- Registration friction reduces initial engagement and exploration intent
- Competitive analysis shows leading products offer guest/free-trial exploration
- Guest mode allows users to understand value before commitment
- SP_010 unified architecture enables easy implementation of dual-view (guest vs. authenticated)
- Category dropdown and examples accelerate user progression through workflow
- Mobile-first philosophy requires frictionless onboarding

**Implementation Approach**:
- Track guest mode state separate from authentication state
- Conditional rendering of guest vs. authenticated features
- Example categories: CRM, HR, Finance, Marketing, Sales, Legal
- Quick-start templates: "Find a CRM", "Evaluate HR Systems", "Select Accounting Software"
- Category dropdown auto-populates tech input field with category-relevant suggestions
- Guest users can explore all workflow steps but cannot save/export (authentication gated)
- Seamless transition: guest exploration → sign up → full workflow with saved context

**Impact**:
- Removes registration barrier - immediate value demonstration
- Dual-view architecture extends reach without fragmenting codebase
- Example categories accelerate vendor selection workflow (reduces time-to-value)
- Improved conversion funnel: explore (guest) → understand value → authenticate → full workflow
- Mobile-friendly quick-start reduces friction on small screens
- Maintains security: data persistence, export, project creation all require authentication

**Benefits**:
- Higher initial engagement (no registration gate)
- Faster time-to-value through category selection
- Better mobile conversion (examples reduce typing)
- Competitive advantage vs. registration-first approach
- Preserves full workflow benefits for authenticated users

**Next Review**: After SP_011 implementation and conversion metrics analysis
