## Step 2: Criteria Generation & Refinement

### Interaction 1: Initial Criteria Generation

**Context:** User has completed Step 1 and entered their technology requirements.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Human
    participant AI

    Human->>AI: PROMPT: Generate 20 evaluation criteria for<br/>[Category] based on this description:<br/>[User's detailed requirements]<br/><br/>Budget: [Budget range]<br/>Urgency: [Urgency level]

    Note over AI: Processing...<br/>Analyzing requirements<br/>Generating criteria

    AI-->>Human: OUTPUT:<br/>20 Criteria:<br/>1. [Criterion name] - [importance] - [type]<br/>2. [Criterion name] - [importance] - [type]<br/>...<br/>20. [Criterion name] - [importance] - [type]<br/><br/>EXPLANATION:<br/>[200-300 word explanation of why<br/>these criteria were selected]
```

**Plain English Flow:**

1. **Human provides** (from Step 1):
   - Technology category (e.g., "CRM Software")
   - Detailed description (e.g., "Need a CRM that handles 10,000+ contacts with email automation and sales pipeline management")
   - Budget range (e.g., "$5,000 - $10,000/month")
   - Urgency (e.g., "High")

2. **AI receives request** and generates:
   - 20 evaluation criteria tailored to the requirements
   - Each criterion has:
     - Name (e.g., "Email Automation Workflows")
     - Importance (high/medium/low)
     - Type (feature/technical/business/compliance)
   - Detailed explanation of the selection rationale

3. **Human receives:**
   - Table populated with 20 criteria
   - Explanation appears in chat sidebar

**Example Output:**

```
CRITERIA:
1. Contact Management Capacity - high - feature
2. Email Automation Workflows - high - feature
3. Sales Pipeline Visualization - high - feature
4. API Integration Capabilities - high - technical
5. Mobile App Quality - medium - feature
6. Reporting & Analytics - high - feature
7. Customization Options - medium - feature
8. Data Import/Export - medium - technical
9. Multi-user Collaboration - high - feature
10. Performance & Speed - high - technical
11. Data Security & Encryption - high - compliance
12. Pricing Model Transparency - high - business
13. Customer Support Quality - medium - business
14. Training Resources - medium - business
15. Scalability - medium - technical
16. Third-party Integrations - high - technical
17. Workflow Automation - high - feature
18. GDPR Compliance - high - compliance
19. Backup & Recovery - medium - technical
20. Vendor Reputation - medium - business

EXPLANATION:
These criteria were specifically selected for CRM software evaluation based on your requirement to manage 10,000+ contacts with email automation. The emphasis on contact management capacity and email workflow automation (both rated high importance) directly addresses your core needs. Sales pipeline visualization is crucial for effective CRM usage at scale...
